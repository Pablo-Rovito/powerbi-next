This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Main use

The main idea is to make PowerBI reports, typically for the internal client, accessible in a custom U/I with a page that can be scalable. 
It doesn't do much other than show an example report when PowerBI is running and one has the right credentials. 

In a company, reports would be accessible through an API and with specific credentials, so it would be scalable. 

As is the case with custom development, literally ANYTHING could be done for making the page useful and compliant of any company's standards.


## Next steps

-Learning actual PowerBI for being able to improve accesibility.
-Making it responsive would be nice, PowerBI has specific options for phone displays.
